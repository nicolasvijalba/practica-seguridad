### Description

This application was purposely coded insecurely, having a large number of vulnerabilities and bad practices. The idea is to simulate an initial blog structure, made by a novice programmer who made serious mistakes, leaving it vulnerable to numerous attacks.

We use this application for educational purposes only, making demonstrations on how to manually and automatically detect these vulnerabilities and also how to fix them.
